# Data Submission Guide for Bacterial Genomics Databases

## Overview
This guide covers preparing and submitting bacterial genomic data to three major international databases.

## BaSys 2 (https://basys2.ca/)
**Purpose:** Bacterial strains database for genomic and phenotypic data
- **What it does:** Houses curated bacterial strain information, genomic sequences, and associated metadata
- **Data requirements:**
    - Strain identification and taxonomy
    - Genomic sequences (FASTA format)
    - Phenotypic characteristics
    - Culture collection information

## TYGS (https://tygs.dsmz.de/)
**Purpose:** Type Strain Genome Server
- **What it does:** Provides genome-based species delineation and taxonomic analysis for bacterial type strains
- **Data requirements:**
    - Complete or draft genome assemblies
    - Type strain designation confirmation
    - Strain metadata (isolation source, date, location)
    - 16S rRNA gene sequence

## GGDC (https://ggdc.dsmz.de/)
**Purpose:** Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator
- **What it does:** Calculates genetic distances between genomes for species delineation and phylogenetic analysis
- **Data requirements:**
    - Genome sequences in FASTA format
    - Genome assembly quality metrics
    - Corresponding metadata

## General Preparation Steps
1. Validate genome assembly quality
2. Verify taxonomic information
3. Prepare metadata in standardized format
4. Check sequence file formats
5. Submit through respective web interfaces
