# Quality Control Through De Novo Annotation

## Overview
This guide focuses on transforming raw ONT sequencing data into annotated bacterial genomes. You'll learn quality control, de novo assembly, and functional annotation without relying on reference genomes.

**Learning Objectives**:
- Assess and improve ONT read quality
- Perform de novo genome assembly
- Evaluate assembly quality metrics
- Annotate genes and predict functions
